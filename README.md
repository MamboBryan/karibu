# Karibu

This is a test project to try and build a library that checks if a details.cpp file is present 
in the root project directory.

## What To Do
[ ] Library checks if file exists on install
    [ ] Build should fail if file doesn't exist 
[ ] Library replaces the contents of the details.cpp file inside the library with
the contents found in the details.cpp file found in the root directory
